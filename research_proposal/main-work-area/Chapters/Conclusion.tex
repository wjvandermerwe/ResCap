% 		\begin{itemize}
% 			\item reiterating the relevant gaps in the current literature,
% 			\item reiterating the aim of the research,
% 			\item emphasising the contribution that the proposed research will make to current research in the field.

With this research proposal, a comprehensive framework is outlined for comparing the effectiveness of Random Survival Forest and Lasso-Cox models in analyzing censored survival data through rigorous simulation studies. By implementing the ADMEP approach and utilizing advanced data-generating mechanisms, this study aims to produce empirical insights into the models' behavior and effectiveness under varying conditions, as well as the effects of simulation both on the outcome predictions and overall output. The expected outcomes are to deliver a better understanding of model performance across statistical and machine learning methods, contributing to more informed choices in survival analysis applications.
