\section{Research design} \label{design}
For the proposed research, a rigorous framework has been formalized by \parencite{morris_using_2019} and will be referred to as (ADMEP). As \parencite{morris_using_2019} states, "Simulation studies are used to obtain empirical results about the behavior of statistical methods in certain scenarios, as opposed to analytic results", which is at the foundation of the objectives of this research. In essence, this study aims to produce results that accurately represent the efficacy of the Random Survival Forest \parencite{ishwaran_random_2008} and the Cox proportional hazards model \parencite{cox_regression_1972}.

\end{figure}

\noindent Taking inspiration from the the application of ADMEP by \parencite{pawel_pitfalls_2024}, the following sections define the research broadly:

\subsection{Aims}
\begin{itemize} 
\item To evaluate how effectively the Random Survival Forest and Lasso-Cox models predict survival outcomes.
\item To understand model behavior under varying conditions of data complexity and censoring rates.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Data-generating mechanisms}
\begin{itemize}
\item Simulate datasets with packages like \parencite{davidson-pilon_lifelines_2024} to introduce complexities like varying censoring rates and non-linear effects.
\item Introduce multicollinearity and various interaction effects to challenge the models' assumptions and robustness.
\item In case of spare time and ahead-of-schedule succesful implementation, explore individual survival distributions \parencite{haider_effective_2018}, as well as competing risk data \parencite{meng_simulating_2023}.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Missing Data Imputation}

\subsubsection{Data Simulation}
\textit{Parametric Distribution}
\par \noindent This method is used to simulate survival times using predefined parametric distributions. The fit of each distribution to the data is tested using the one-sample Cram√©r-von Mises (CVM) test. The distribution that shows the least deviation from the data (highest p-value in the CVM test) is chosen for simulation. Parameters for these distributions are estimated using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). An Example for mixed distribution: 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:paramdist}f(x)=0.2.f_{Weibull}(\alpha,\lambda)+0.8.f_{norm}(\mu,\sigma)(x)\end{equation}
\noindent Where \(f_{Weibull(\alpha, \lambda)}\) and \(f_{norm}(\mu,\sigma)\) are the density functions for the Weibull and normal distributions, respectively.
\\\\
\textit{Kernel Density Estimation (KDE)}
\par \noindent Used to estimate by utilizing the density function of the data for simulation. The density function is estimated using the kdensity function from the \parencite{thurow_how_2023} R-package, which employs a Gaussian kernel. The Accept-reject method is used to generate random values that follow the estimated density function. Draw \((X, U)\) from the joint distribution \((X, U) ~ \left\{ (x,u):0<u<f(x)\right\}\) where X is a random variable following the estimated density f, and U is uniformly distributed between 0 and \(f(x)\). If \(u_{i} < f(x_{i})\) for a sampled \((X,U),x_{i}\) is accepted as a realization from the density function \(f\)
\\\\
\textit{Case Resampling}
\par \noindent Simulate data by resampling observed data points with replacement. Directly resample observations (ti, di) from the existing dataset of observed times and censoring indicators. \((t_{i}, d_{i})^{*}\) are drawn with replacement from \(\left\{ (t_{1}, d_{1}) \dots (t_{n}, d_{n})\right\}\)
\\\\
\textit{Conditional Bootstrapping}
\par \noindent To simulate data using bootstrapping that accounts for censoring, this helps sample censor times. For censored observations, censoring times are carried over to the simulated data. For uncensored observations, new censoring times are sampled based on the conditional distribution of censoring times given they are greater than the observed event time. Censoring Time for censored data: \(c_{i}^{*} = t_{i}\) for censored observation. Censoring Time for uncensored data: \(c_{i}^{*}\) is sampled from \(G_{i}(c) = \frac{G(c)-G(t_{i})}{1-G(t_{i})}\) where \(G\) is the distribution function of censoring times and \(t_{i}\) is the observed event time. Event times \(t^{*}_{oi}\) are sampled from the observed event times with replacement. \parencite{thurow_how_2023} show that for the reconstruction of reliable benchmark data sets are meticulously reconstructed from published Kaplan-Meier plots and other vital statistics like hazard ratios and p-values from log-rank tests. The data sets, particularly those with non-crossing survival curves, demonstrate high fidelity to the original data, proving them to be excellent resources for subsequent model evaluations.
\subsubsection{Synthetic Data Generation}
\noindent \parencite{norcliffe_survivalgan_2023} Employ several metrics to assess synthetic survival data according to the real dataset. They help identify and correct biases in synthetic data to better align with real-world data, enhancing the credibility of survival analysis models. The optimism metric assesses whether the synthetic data is over-optimistic or over-pessimistic compared to real data by comparing the expected lifetimes derived from Kaplan-Meier (KM) plots.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:optimisim}\text{Optimism} = \frac{1}{T} \int_{0}^{T}(S_{Syn}(t)-S_{Real}(t))dt\end{equation}
\noindent Where \(S_{Syn}(t) and S_{Real}(t)\) are the synthetic and real Kaplan-Meier survival functions respectively, and T is the latest time point available. The optimism metric ranges between -1 and 1, where values closer to 0 indicate accurate lifetime predictions, positive values suggest over-optimism, and negative values indicate over-pessimism. The short-sightedness metric quantifies how much earlier synthetic data, discontinues providing predictions compared to real data, reflecting potential censorship in the synthetic modeling.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:ssmetric}\text{Short-Sightedness} = \frac{T_{Real}-T_{Syn}}{T_{Real}}\end{equation}
\noindent Here, \(T_{Syn} and T_{Real}\) are the end times of the synthetic and real Kaplan-Meier plots, respectively. This metric ranges from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates no censorship issues and 1 indicates complete short-sightedness in the synthetic data predictions. Lastly, the Kaplan-Meier divergence measures the overall divergence between the synthetic and real KM curves across the observed time period, providing a comprehensive measure of similarity between the two datasets.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:kmdiverge}\text{KM Divergence} = \frac{1}{T}\int_{0}^{T}|S_{Syn}(t)-S_{Real}(t)|dt\end{equation}
\noindent This formula calculates the mean absolute difference between the synthetic and real survival functions over time, scaled by the total duration observed. The KM divergence values range from 0 to 1, where 0 indicates perfect matching KM curves and 1 represents the maximum possible difference.

\subsection{Methods}
\begin{itemize}
\item Random Survival Forest: Implement using a combination of proposed packages in \ref{methods}, tuning tree-related parameters.
\item Lasso-Cox Model: Use a combination of the proposed packages in \ref{methods} for implementing Cox regression with Lasso regularization, optimizing the regularization strength and model complexity. 
\item Explore integration effects from the different packages.
\item In case of spare time and ahead-of-schedule successful implementation, explore adaptations of core methods.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Cox Proportional Hazards Model}
The proposition consists of covariates, known as attributes regarding a unit in a distribution of data, which is associated with a coefficient \(\beta\) scaling the impact of said covariates; this product is then bound by the baseline hazard \(h_{0}(t)\).
\begin{equation} \label{eq:cox}h(t|X) = h_0(t) \exp(\beta_1 X_1 + \beta_2 X_2 + \ldots + \beta_n X_n)\end{equation}
An assumption of the Cox model is the proportional hazards assumption, suggesting that the hazard ratios for different covariates remain constant over time we see this for two events observations. This is an operational Assumption and a limitation as this is not always true for survival data. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coxph}\frac{h(t|X_1)}{h(t|X_2)} = \frac{h_0(t) \exp(\beta^T X_1)}{h_0(t) \exp(\beta^T X_2)} = \frac{\exp(\beta^T X_1)}{\exp(\beta^T X_2)} = \exp(\beta^T (X_1 - X_2))\end{equation}
The model can handle censoring, by adjusting the likelihood function for observations where event occurrence did not happen in a particular continuous time frame, and by maximising the likelihood of all observed events, it is possible to estimate the coefficients that could work the best under the Cox formulation.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:coxlikely}L(\beta) = \prod_{i: \delta_i = 1} \frac{\exp(\beta^T X_i)}{\sum_{j \in R(t_i)} \exp(\beta^T X_j)}\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Lasso Regularisation}
\noindent The Lasso technique \parencite{tibshirani_regression_1996}, a regression analysis method introduced to address specific limitations of Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) estimation, is particularly beneficial in scenarios with a large number of predictors or high collinearity among them which would mean that models could produce inflated variance scores, and cause impaired interpretability. Lasso optimises prediction accuracy and enhances model interpretability by employing a shrinkage process that can set certain coefficients to zero effectively, thus performing variable selection.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lasso}\hat{\beta}^{lasso} = \arg \min_{\beta} \left\{ \frac{1}{2N} \sum_{i=1}^{N} (y_i - \beta_0 - \sum_{j=1}^{p} X_{ij}\beta_j)^2 \right\}\end{equation}
bound by,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lassobound}\sum_{j=1}^{p} |\beta_j| \leq t.\end{equation}
\noindent \parencite{freijeirogonzalez_critical_2022} The inclusion of the regularisation term, is crucial as it allows for the reduction of model complexity by penalising the magnitude of the coefficients, which promotes sparser models. This sparsity is instrumental in enhancing interpretability by isolating only the most significant predictors that contribute to the dependent variable. The objective function of LASSO is convex for \(l_{1}\) norm, which simplifies finding the global minimum. Multiple optimal solutions might exist, especially when the number of predictors \(p\) exceeds the number of observations \(n\). \parencite{freijeirogonzalez_critical_2022} LASSO introduces bias in the coefficients to achieve lower variance and better model parsimony. Consistent under conditions like the irrepresentable condition, crucial for variable selection. Bias Correction achieved via,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:lassobais}\hat{\beta}_{j}^{LASSO}=sign(\hat{\beta}_{j}^{OLS})(|\hat{\beta}_{j}^{OLS}| - \lambda)_{+}\end{equation}
\subsubsection{Random Survival Forest}
\noindent Random survival forests \parencite{ishwaran_random_2008} are an extension of random forests, which can handle right-censored data and aim to estimate the appropriate survival function. Consisting of an ensemble of trees \parencite{ishwaran_random_2008}, which are grown from a bootstrap sample, and each node of underlying trees, consists of specific covariates due to a random selection of features for splits in each tree. Random forests are adapted for survival analysis by modifying how predictions are aggregated to handle censored data effectively. Forest survival function estimator:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:rsfestimator}\hat{\Lambda}(t, x_{0}) = \frac{1}{B} \sum_{b=1}^{B} \hat{\Lambda}_{b}(t,x_{0})\end{equation}
Survival function:
\begin{equation} \label{eq:survrsf}S(t,x_{0}) = \exp^{-\hat{\Lambda}(t,x_{0})}\end{equation}
The OOB error is calculated on the ensemble survival function of the observed data using metrics like concordance (C-index). Used for estimating prediction error and model performance without a separate test data set. Each tree's error is calculated using data not included in its training set (out-of-bag). Prediction error metrics, like the concordance index which calculates the permissible pairs per node and OOB prediction error, are used for accuracy metrics. 

\begin{equation} \label{eq:ooberror}
\hat{\Lambda}_{oob}(t,x_{i}) = \frac{1}{\sum_{b=1}^{B}I(x_{i}\in L^{b}_{oob})}\sum_{b=1}^{B}I(x_{i}\in L^{b}_{oob})\hat{\Lambda}_{b}(t,x_{i})
\end{equation}


\subsection{Estimands}
\begin{itemize}
\item Focus on estimations, like survival functions, hazard ratios, etc. for both models and survival probabilities at specified time points.
\item Analyze feature importance in RSF and assess how Lasso regularization affects the selection of covariates in the Cox model.
\item Bootstrap samples to build confidence intervals for key estimands, ensuring the robustness of the findings.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Performance measures}
\begin{itemize}
\item Use statistical tests, like the C-index, and integrated Brier score as proposed in \ref{eval} to compare the RSF and Lasso-Cox model's performance metrics, like predictive accuracy and calibration across time.
\item Apply graphical methods like Kaplan-Meier curves to visualize survival estimates against actual outcomes.
\item Conduct sensitivity analysis to explore the impact of model parameters on their performance.
\end{itemize}

\section{Data}
\noindent The process of finding a dataset suitable for the study forms part of research execution. I will focus on sourcing data from reputable, well-established libraries such as UCI Machine Learning Repository, Kaggle, and available software libraries examples being, \parencite{nagpal_auton-survival_2022} \parencite{davidson-pilon_lifelines_2024} \parencite{sebastian_polsterl_scikit-survival_2023}. This approach guarantees access to a diverse array of well-documented datasets, ensuring both reliability and reproducibility of the results. It is important to note that the selection of data generation mechanisms (DGM), is indirectly dependent on the dataset chosen, so it is important to incorporate and accommodate the selection process toward ease of implementation of the DGM. Furthermore, when selecting the dataset censoring levels, FAIR principles \parencite{wilkinson_fair_2016}, reproducibility by assessing data simulation accuracy similar to the KM-Divergence metric used by \parencite{norcliffe_survivalgan_2023} are all important considerations. Utilizing this approach voids the need to carefully assess the ethical implications of using the datasets as these datasets should be under public licensed availability. Lastly, I don't foresee data preprocessing steps, being necessary, as DGM for simulation are commonly categorized as postprocessing \parencite{jin_imputation_2024}. 

\section{Methods} \label{methods}
I show a few widely used libraries within the field of survival analysis. The popularity of these libraries is qualitatively assessed based on metrics such as the number of GitHub stars, which serve as a proxy for community approval and usage frequency. Additionally, the maintenance history of these libraries is evaluated by examining the date of the most recent commit, providing insight into their current relevance and reliability. A detailed overview of these libraries is presented in the accompanying table, illustrating their prominence and role in both historical and contemporary research within the survival analysis space. To ensure robustness and interoperability in my research, I aim to adopt common software standards across different execution libraries. A notable example is the use of the pandas DataFrame object which is a very popular data structure. This will allow integration of various libraries, allowing for options across research phases (evaluation, model execution, etc.), and by standardizing data structures across different tools, I can minimize compatibility issues and streamline the process of switching between different analytical methods and environments.

\noindent I plan to use the above packages, or packages that might gain more popularity that were not investigated at the time of writing this document, to perform the comparative study between a random survival forest implementation and the lasso regularized Cox proportional hazards model, using simulated data according to the ADMEP research design proposal in \ref{design}

\section{Limitations} \label{methlim}
A massive limitation is that the research is tightly coupled, meaning the phases are strictly dependent on each other. This is an antipattern, \parencite{joshi_beginning_2016}, which should be planned to accommodate any failures during any of the research phases. In cases where results do not converge, or the interpretation is wrong, the tightly coupled nature of the research will also affect the preceding stages. Lastly the computation time, within the modern setting should not be a hindrance but the combination of multiple computational components like the DGM and the model execution and results evaluation, is important to take caution. 

\section{Ethical Considerations}
Ethical clearance would not be a component of this study, as the only real data that would be used, will only be selected from open source, or publicly available (public licensing) sources. Due to the nature of the topic, being closely related to sensitive information, it will be an important point of order to note in the case that results indicate or underscore ethical implications.
