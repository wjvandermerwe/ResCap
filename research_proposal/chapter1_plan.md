# Problem Statement

- ideal situation
  - predicting, accurate, low cost, efficient for
    - treatment
    - outcomes
  - Intereting effects of contributing factors/variables
- current situation
  - alot of studies comparing machine learning methods to statistical methods
  - few studies outline that there is a lack when it comes to comparitives and especially simulation studies.
  - preforming a study on methods without introducing a new method in order to decrease bias
- what is intended to do
  - preform a simulation study

# Research aims and objectives

## aims

- To preform comparitive study in which simulation data generation and comparison is preformed according to formal frameworks.
- identify accurate
- evaluate results

## Objectives

- model methodology based on data structures
- apply numerous data generating methods (simulation)
- apply ml and statistical methods
- apply numerous evaluation metrics
- apply visualisation for interpretation
- apply numerous domains of data (group vs induvidual)

## Limitations
