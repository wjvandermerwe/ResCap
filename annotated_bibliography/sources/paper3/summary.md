In this discussion, the paper introduces Random Survival Forests (RSF), an extension of Breiman's forests method, tailored for right-censored survival data. RSF comprises random survival trees grown using independent bootstrap samples, with each tree selecting a subset of variables at nodes and employing a survival criterion. The fully grown trees contribute to an ensemble, and an out-of-bag (OOB) ensemble allows for nearly unbiased prediction error estimation.

RSF incorporates ideas from Breiman (2001) and introduces novel extensions, including a missing data algorithm applicable to both training and testing data. Through extensive experimentation, RSF demonstrates consistently superior or comparable prediction accuracy across various real and simulated datasets compared to competing methods. The study highlights the ease of applying RSF to reveal complex relationships in real data, illustrated by a case study on coronary artery disease. The results emphasize RSF's adaptability and efficiency in identifying intricate interrelationships among variables, contrasting with conventional methods requiring more subjective input in highly interrelated data settings.
