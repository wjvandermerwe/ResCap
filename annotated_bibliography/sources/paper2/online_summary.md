Mathematical Formulation: In linear regression, we aim to minimize the sum of squared errors between the predicted values and the actual values. The lasso regularization adds a penalty term to this objective function, which is the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients multiplied by a regularization parameter λ. This penalty term is added to the least squares objective function to form the lasso objective function:

Objective function = Sum of squared errors + λ \* Sum of absolute values of coefficients

Variable Selection: The lasso penalty has the property of setting some coefficients exactly to zero, effectively performing variable selection. This means that some features are entirely excluded from the model, simplifying it and potentially improving its interpretability.

Geometric Interpretation: Geometrically, the lasso penalty is a diamond-shaped constraint in the coefficient space. The intersection of this diamond with the contours of the least squares objective function determines the optimal coefficients. Depending on the location of the contours relative to the diamond, some coefficients are pushed to zero.

Proofs:

The convexity of the lasso penalty term ensures that the objective function is convex, facilitating efficient optimization.
The KKT (Karush-Kuhn-Tucker) conditions can be used to derive the solution to the lasso optimization problem. These conditions characterize the optimal solution by considering the gradient of the objective function and the properties of the lasso penalty.

Overall, lasso regularization is a powerful technique for improving the performance and interpretability of regression models, especially in high-dimensional settings with many features.
